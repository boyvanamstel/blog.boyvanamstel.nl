The EA games discount that [gog.com](http://gog.com) ran a little while ago allowed me to buy some of my favorite games from the past (Theme Hospital!, Wing Commander!) for a pretty good price. The problem with gog.com for Mac users is that all games are Windows-only. Or at least they were. Gog has teamed with [Alun Bestor](https://twitter.com/viggles), the creator of [Boxer](http://boxerapp.com/) to bring the games to OSX.

Boxer makes it super easy to bundle old DOS games into neat .app packages; ready to play with the click of a button. Bringing that to gog.com means I can simply download the games and start playing. Awesome!

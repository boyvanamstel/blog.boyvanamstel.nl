Tweeting about [Instacast](http://vemedio.com/products/instacast3) made me review the podcasts I like. Why not share them here?

<!-- more -->

Most shows on my list are Apple development and game orientated. I'm still looking for a few that cover web development. Anyway, in a _slightly_ particular order, these are the podcasts I enjoy listening to.

* [Core Intuition](http://www.coreint.org/): "A podcast about indie software development for the Mac, iOS and other Apple technologies"
  <div>Hosted by Daniel Jalkut ([@danielpunkass](http://twitter.com/danielpunkass)) and Manton Reece ([@manton](https://alpha.app.net/manton)).</div>

* [Developing Perspective](http://developingperspective.com/): "A podcast discussing news of note in iOS Development, Apple and the like."
	<div>David Smith ([@_DavidSmith](https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith)) talks about his experiences as a independent iOS and Mac developer. I like how it covers the things he comes across in his daily activities. It's always around 15 minutes, making it super convenient to listen to when you have a moment to spare.</div>

* [The Talk Show With John Gruber](http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow): "Sort of like the directorâ€™s commentary track for Daring Fireball."

* [Software Indie](http://softwareindie.com/): "Empowering Indie Software Makers To Be Better At What They Do"
  <div>A spin-off from the [iDeveloper Live](http://ideveloper.tv/podcast/ideveloperlive.html) podcast, hosted by Steve 'Scotty' Scott ([@scotty](https://alpha.app.net/scotty)). Very specifically aimed at independent software development.</div>

* [ScrewAttack's SideScrollers](http://www.screwattack.com/shows/originals/sidescrollers): "The most entertaining 30 to 45 minutes of your video game week"
  <div>I like ScrewAttack and their video game items, both on their website and in the podcast.</div>
  
I'm pretty loyal to the podcasts above and try to stay up to date. Occasionally I'll listen to an episode of [Identical Cousins](http://identicalcousins.net/), [Video Game Hangover](http://vghangover.com), [Bloody Good Horror](http://www.bloodygoodhorror.com/) and a few others.

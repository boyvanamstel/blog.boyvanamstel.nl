[Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) is a tool that I use literally dozens of times a day. Every time
I launch an app, clone a git repo, search on Google et cetera. It's a productivity tool like no
other. One of its coolest features is the ability to create your own productivity
boosters, by making (and sharing) 'workflows'.

I recently made [a workflow that adds keyboard controls to Reign](http://dangercove.com/blog/2013/08/11/alfred-2-workflow-for-reign/),
the Spotify remote that works on any device with a browser.

As Alfred's own documentation can be somewhat lacking around workflows, I
thought I'd share my experience. As such, this is by no means a definitive guide, 
just some things I learned in the process.

## Getting to know workflows

![All the workflows I've setup](/images/media/alfred/workflows.png)

While Alfred 2 if free, you'll need [the Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) to be
able to create and import workflows. So get that, if you didn't have it already.

A basic workflow gets some ```input```, performs an ```action``` and optionally
shows some ```output```. Alfred passes the return value of each of these steps to the 
next. Additionally you can activate a workflow using a ```trigger```, like a hotkey 
or file action. While the workflow is active, it can use Alfred's interface to 
show ```feedback```, like preset actions or autocomplete suggestions.

Simple workflows can be a matter of dragging and dropping the right components
on the canvas and connecting the dots. The solution I was after required
some scripting though. This is where Alfred really shines, with support for
Bash, Zsh, PHP, Ruby, Python, Perl and osascript (Apple Script).

You can write scripts directly into the text area, but when things get a little more
extensive it's probably easier to use a Bash script to invoke your script.

## Using a template project

I chose Ruby because I wanted to take advantage of its network and JSON
parsing capabilities. Some of these features are contained in gems that might not available on
every Mac without installing them first. It's quite easy to install Gems locally
and include them with your Ruby project, but I was hoping to find a tool
that does this work for me and could provide me with some wrapper functions
around Alfred specific functions.

After some digging around I discovered [Zhao Cai's](https://github.com/zhaocai) [alfred2-ruby-template](https://github.com/zhaocai/alfred2-ruby-template).
This template contains everything you need to include gems with your
workflow and actually streamlines the development process a great deal. I won't
go over the entire setup process here. Zhao has explained pretty much all of it
in the Quick Start Guide section on the GitHub page mentioned before.

## Goal

To put this walkthrough in some perspective, these were the goals I had for the
workflow.

* Activate by entering a specific keyword;
* Find/set/save the ip address/hostname and port for the Reign server;
* Execute play/pause/next/previous commands;
* Show 'Now Playing' information;
* Open the current track in a local Spotify client.

All these features are available through [Reign's API](http://dangercove.com/reign/developers/),
by accessing specific URLs.

{% highlight bash %}
http://[ip/hostname]:[port]/playpause = Toggle play/pause
http://[ip/hostname]:[port]/next = Next song
http://[ip/hostname]:[port]/previous = Previous song
http://[ip/hostname]:[port]/nowplaying = Returns the artist and title for the current track
http://[ip/hostname]:[port]/status = Returns a JSON response with more song information (including a Spotify URI)
{% endhighlight %}

## The actual workflow (finally..)

Alright, with all the context in place, let's get to work on the workflow! You
can [get the full source for this workflow on GitHub](https://github.com/DangerCove/reign-alfred2-workflow).

### Edit your workflow description

After following the template setup, you should have a folder containing your
workflow and an empty canvas in Alfred.

Start off by entering some information about your workflow. Double-click your
workflow in the overview on the left to do so.

![We'll use the Script Filter input](/images/media/alfred/workflowinfo.jpg)

### Setup the workflow input

To activate the workflow I wanted to use the keyword ```reign```. As soon as I
type that into Alfred, a script should run. Alfred provides a component called
a ```Script Filter``` that does just that. Add it to the canvas by clicking the
circled ```+``` in the top right corner and selecting ```Inputs â†’ Script Filter```.

Take a look at the Script Filter that activates the Reign for Spotify workflow.

![Script Filter to trigger the workflow](/images/media/alfred/scriptfilter.jpg)

The most important field is the Keyword, which will trigger the scripts. I
wanted the workflow to complete several tasks (e.g. play/next/previous) and
used an argument to accomplish this. To learn more about how arguments work,
[read this post on Alfred's forums](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/96-understanding-argument-types-in-keywords-and-script-filters/).

You'll notice that I didn't set my language to Ruby, but to Bash. This allows me
to enter a Bash command that runs a Ruby script. I can then edit the script
using my favorite editor.

In this article I want stay away from the code as much as possible (it's
available on GitHub if you want it), but I want to point out
two things that cost me some time to learn.

### Storing settings

For my workflow to work, I need to know the host that will receive the commands
via HTTP. I could add a script to discover hosts using Bonjour (like Reign does),
but that would complicate thing a lot. I chose to just ask for the data and
store it, through Alfred.

Zhao (from the Ruby template, remember) thought of this and provides a way to
save and load settings. Here's what it looks like.

{% highlight ruby %}
Alfred.with_friendly_error do |alfred|
  
  # Save settings
  alfred.setting.dump({ "host", value })

  # Load settings
  settings = alfred.setting.load
  puts settings['host']

end
{% endhighlight %}

### Feedback

You can pop-up options in Alfred, while typing. Like "Copy 'Ozzy Osbourne -
Crazy Train'" in the screenshot at the start of this article. This is called ```feedback```
and frankly is quite cool.

{% highlight ruby %}
Alfred.with_friendly_error do |alfred|
  
  fb = alfred.feedback

  fb.add_item({
    :uid      => "",
    :title    => "Copy '#{np}'", 
    :subtitle => "Copy to clipboard.",
    :arg      => np, # This gets passed as 'output' when the user selects the item
    :valid    => "yes"
  })

end
{% endhighlight %}

After the user selects one of these options the assigned ```arg``` gets passed
to the next item in the workflow.

Caveat: one thing I noticed was that when you pass user input in the ```arg```
it might not 'be there' instantly if the user presses return too soon. Still
looking for a way around that.

## Sharing

To share your workflow with others, right-click it and select ```Export```.
This will save your workflow as an ```.alfredworkflow``` file. Others can add
this to their setup by simply double-clicking it.

![Export your workflow](/images/media/alfred/export.jpg)

Add your workflow to [the list](http://www.alfredforum.com/forum/3-share-your-workflows/)
on Alfred's forums. Try to spot Reign's entry. Also consider putting it up on GitHub.

## Updating

While you continue to work on your workflow, you'll want people to be able to update to
the latest version. There's currently no official way to go about this, but
[Alleyoop](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1582-alleyoop-update-alfred-workflows/)
gets the job done.

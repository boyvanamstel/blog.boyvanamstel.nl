I'm Boy van Amstel, an independent creative programmer, experimenter, video game collector and snowboarder from [Leiden, the Netherlands](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Leiden/@52.1517316,4.4465647,13z).

Most of my days are spent working on apps for the company that I founded in 2011, called [Danger Cove](http://www.dangercove.com). [Porthole](http://www.dangercove.com/porthole) for example; a Mac app that allows you to stream audio to multiple AirPlay speakers.

I'm particularly interested in experimenting with new technology and making it accessible to a broad audiance. I focus on providing simple, straight forward user experiences for seemingly complicated tasks. Most of the code ends up on [my GitHub page](http://github.org/boyvanamstel) or [the one I keep at Danger Cove](http://github.com/dangercove).

I also like to reflect on how people interact with technical innovations using websites like [Please Rob Me](http://www.pleaserobme.com/) and [ePenis](http://www.epenis.nl/).

You can find me on Twitter as [@boyvanamstel](http://twitter.com/boyvanamstel). Where I comment on tech news, talk about programming (mostly Mac/iOS and web orientated) and share 80's hits.

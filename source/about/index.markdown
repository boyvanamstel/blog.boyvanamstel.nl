My name is Boy. I'm a creative programmer, experimenter, video game collector and snowboarder from The Hague, the Netherlands.

Most of my days are spent working on projects for the company I founded in 2011, called [Danger Cove](http://dangercove.com). We create apps that make our lives easier and sell them to people that are similar to us. [Porthole](http://getporthole.com) for example, which allows you to stream audio to multiple AirPlay speakers. We also tell other companies how to [manage their products](http://zeewaardig.com).

I'm particularly interested in experimenting with new technology and making it accessible to a broader audiance. Usually through simple experiments. Check out [my GitHub page](http://github.org/boyvanamstel) or [the one we keep at Danger Cove](http://github.com/dangercove) for some of those. I also like to reflect on how people interact with technical innovations using websites like [Please Rob Me](http://www.pleaserobme.com/) and [ePenis](http://www.epenis.nl/).

You can contact me for a pleasant conversation, public speaking or help with something you're working on. I like to talk about the following topics:

* Rapid development and prototyping;
* Native Mac applications and Objective-C;
* Native mobile applications and Android and iOS;
* Web sites/apps and HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, WebGL, Ruby on Rails and NodeJS;
* Product management and statistics;
* Video games.

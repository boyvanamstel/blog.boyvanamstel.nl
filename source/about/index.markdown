My name is Boy. I love to create clever concepts and applications for all kinds of platforms.

I love web services, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Ruby (on Rails), Python, PHP, Objective-C, Java, Git, Linux, OSX, snowboarding & retro video games. I also have horrible [taste in music](http://www.last.fm/user/boyvanamstel).

My area of expertise lies in using existing (cloud) services to rapidly create innovative applications. Preferably using client-side scripting (javascript), frameworks like Ruby on Rails or mobile platforms such as Android and iPhone/iPad.

Besides the above I like to work on streamlining development processes by crafting tools and implementing systems like Git.

You may know me from sites like [Please Rob Me](http://www.pleaserobme.com/) and [ePenis](http://www.epenis.nl/). Also checkout my [GitHub page](http://github.org/boyvanamstel) and [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/boyvanamstel).

Do you have a project youâ€™d like me to work on? [Contact me](mailto:info@boyvanamstel.nl)!

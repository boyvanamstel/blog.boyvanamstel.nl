Most of my days are spent working on projects for the company I founded in 2011, called [Danger Cove](http://dangercove.com). I make apps that make my live (and the lives of others, hopefully) easier. [Porthole](http://getporthole.com) for example, allows you to stream audio to multiple AirPlay speakers.

I'm particularly interested in experimenting with new technology and making it accessible to a broad audiance. Check out [my GitHub page](http://github.org/boyvanamstel) or [the one I keep at Danger Cove](http://github.com/dangercove) for some more on that. I also like to reflect on how people interact with technical innovations using websites like [Please Rob Me](http://www.pleaserobme.com/) and [ePenis](http://www.epenis.nl/).

Other things that describe me or that I like to talk about:

* Rapid development and prototyping;
* Impact of technical innovations on people;
* Native Mac applications and Objective-C;
* Native mobile applications and Android and iOS;
* Web sites/apps and HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, WebGL, Ruby on Rails and NodeJS;
* Product management and statistics;
* Video games.

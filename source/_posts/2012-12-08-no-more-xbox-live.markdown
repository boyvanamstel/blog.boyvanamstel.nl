My Xbox Live subscription expired this week. The 6th of December to be precise. Unlike many years before I didn't even look into renewing it this time.

There are two reasons for that. One is that I just didn't use it that much this year; I think Modern Warfare 3 was the last game I played online. The other is that I'm just too content with Playstation Plus. Not that it's a problem to have both at the same time, but since Playstation Plus (and my PS3's 500GB HD upgrade) I've been using my Xbox less and less. Mainly because Playstation Plus has made it super easy to statisfy my gaming hobby.

I like collecting video games. I like looking at the boxes they come in and storing them in cabinets. Before Playstation Plus (and the Humble Bundle) I had trouble adapting to digital-only games. There just wasn't an advantage for me. Games would cost about the same and there was no way to put them in cabinets and look at them.

Now with Playstation Plus I just get a bunch of free games every month. I don't like all of them, but they are practically forced into my collection. And apparently that worked. It changed me. I have no problem buying games and just getting a code or download link anymore. I think I might even prefer digital to physical copies..

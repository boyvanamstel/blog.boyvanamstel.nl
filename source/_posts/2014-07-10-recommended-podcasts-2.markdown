It's been a little over a year since the last time [I posted a list of podcasts](/2013/06/recommended-podcasts/) that I tune to.

This is an update. Some shows have stayed, some have gone and there are numerous new ones.

<!-- more -->

Most of my subscriptions remain Apple oriented, but in comparison to last year, I listen to a few extra video game oriented shows.

## New Shows

### Apple & Tech

* [Release Notes](http://releasenotes.tv/): "Release Notes is a weekly podcast about the business of Mac and iOS indie software development. We discuss inspiration, design, trends, and tools â€” everything but the code."
  <div>I love listening to Charles Perry and Joe Cieplinski talking about much of the things I go through as well, as a software indie. Probably my favorite show at the moment.</div>

* [Build Phase](http://podcasts.thoughtbot.com/buildphase): "Build Phase is a weekly technical podcast discussing iOS development and design. Hosted by iOS developers Mark Adams and Gordon Fontenot; they discuss code, design, and creating great iOS apps."
  <div>A bit more technically in-depth than most shows, which I like a lot. My only critique is that they focus primarily on iOS, while I spend most of my time on OS X apps.</div>

* [Accidental Tech](http://atp.fm/): "Three nerds discussing tech and loosely related matters. An offshoot from Neutral, our car show."
  <div>General Apple and tech stuff, hosted by Marco Arment, Casey Liss and John Siracusa.</div>

### Games

* [All Gen Gamers](http://www.allgengamers.com/): "We take pride in ourselves as video game enthusiasts and collectors of the hobby."
  <div>Very enjoyable show about being a gamer, hosted by Pete Dorr, Gamester81, Jason Heine and MetalJesusRocks. I love the conversations about retro games and consoles.</div>

* [Video Game Hangover](http://vghangover.com/): "Video Game Hangover is podcast by three guys who love--and occasionally overindulge in--gaming."
  <div>Randy Dickinson, D.J. Ross and Paul Sandhu discuss the games they play and games that come out.</div>

* [Player One Podcast](http://www.playeronepodcast.com/): "Join ex-game journalists Chris Johnston, Phil Theobald, Greg Sewart and their buddy Mike Phillips as they talk about console/portable/PC games, babies, and the meaning of life."

## Old Favorites

* [Core Intuition](http://www.coreint.org/): "A podcast about indie software development for the Mac, iOS and other Apple technologies"
  <div>Daniel Jalkut and Manton Reece have both been working in the Apple ecosystem for years and use the experience to comment on new developments and being an indie.</div>

* [Developing Perspective](http://developingperspective.com/): "A podcast discussing news of note in iOS Development, Apple and the like."
  <div>David Smith ([@_DavidSmith](https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith)) talks about his experiences as a independent iOS and Mac developer. I like how it covers the things he comes across in his daily activities. It's always around 15 minutes, making it super convenient to listen to when you have a moment to spare.</div>
  <div>David actually did [a show about _his_ favorite podcasts](http://developingperspective.com/2014/06/26/0/) a little while ago. Definitely worth listening to. Links to the shows are in the show notes.</div>
  
## Skipping Episodes

I try to stay up to date with the podcasts above, generally skipping more episodes on the game related shows. 

I tend to skip Apple and tech episodes if they solely cover recent news. Unless I'm very curious about someone's point of view, written news has usually informed me well enough before the podcast comes out.

## Remarkable Episodes

Steve Gaynor hosts a pretty cool show called [Tone Control](https://www.idlethumbs.net/tonecontrol) in which he "sits down with noteworthy video game developers for an in-depth conversation about their career and creative process". 

I'm a subscriber, but ended up especially enjoying [the episode with Tim Shafer](https://www.idlethumbs.net/tonecontrol/episodes/tim-schafer). Highly recommended if you're into Tim's work.

## Listening Environment

Apart from listening while working, I've also made a habit of tuning into a show during chores, like doing the dishes. It allows me to pay much more attention and generally makes me enjoy the episodes even more.

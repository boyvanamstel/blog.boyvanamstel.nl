Created [a tiny project on GitHub](https://github.com/boyvanamstel/JConsole) with a simple piece of Javascript to see what [JSLint](http://jslint.com/) does.

Pretty cool and something I’ll definitely incorporate in deploy scripts. Checkout the example website [here](http://boyvanamstel.github.com/JConsole/) and the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/boyvanamstel/JConsole).

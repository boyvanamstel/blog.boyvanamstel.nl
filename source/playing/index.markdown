Video games have been a pretty constant hobby for me, but it seems to have changed in some form of hoarding; buying more than I want or can play. Instead of just buying a single game and finish it, now I play several, usually depending on the situation/location I'm in. These are the games I'm currently playing or look forward to playing.

<h2>Computer game</h2>
The game I play on my laptop.

<strong>None in particular.</strong>
Maybe [Wing Commander Privateer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Commander:_Privateer) from the recent gog.com promo.

I just finished [Gabriel Knight 2: the Beast Within](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_Within:_A_Gabriel_Knight_Mystery); the best FMV game of the 90s (I don't think they were made in any other decade). When it came out, it blew my mind. Now it looks pretty dated, but it offers such an immersive experience. The story is awesome and most of the acting is pretty good. The game's depiction of Germany, German people and American actors talking in German is especially memorable.

The intro and some gameplay.

<h2>Console game</h2>

<strong>None</strong>

Somehow I haven't been playing games on my Xbox or Playstation 3. Even thinking about buying a PC again..

<h2>Bed game</h2>
The game that's on my nightstand.

<strong>Final Fantasy VII/Resident Evil/Metal Gear Solid 2</strong>

Final Fantasy VII and Resident Evil are PSOne classics, but they're still awesome. I think I'll keep replaying those forever. They play pretty awesome on the PS Vita. The Metal Gear Solid HD collection is my first hand at part 2 and 3 in the series. Reasonably fun to play. Sometimes I throw in some Wipeout HD or Super Stardust Delta.

<h2>Toilet game</h2>
Or the game that I play when I have a few minutes to spare.

<strong>Carmageddon on iOS</strong>

I backed [the Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stainlessgames/carmageddon-reincarnation) and the iOS game is just the right appetizer. Plays wonderfully (or at least just as crappy as I remember) and looks great.
